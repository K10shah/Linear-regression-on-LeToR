# Linear-regression-on-LeToR
Applying Linear Regression algorithm to predict the rank of pages.

In this project we applied <b>Linear Regression</b> algorithm to LeToR dataset to predict the ranks of pages to decide their relevancy.

There are two forms of implementation of this algorithm.
<ol>
<li><b>Closed Form solution.</b>
The code for this can be found <a href="https://github.com/K10shah/Linear-regression-on-LeToR/blob/master/closedFormSolution.py">here</a>
<li><b>Stochastic Gradient Descent</b> approach. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/K10shah/Linear-regression-on-LeToR/blob/master/stochasticGradientDescent.py">here</a>
